# The Product-Minded Engineer in the Age of AI-Driven Development

A product-minded engineer goes beyond implementing tickets; they understand users, question assumptions, propose better solutions, and help shape the product’s direction. We'll also discuss why this way of thinking is even more essential in the age of AI-driven development, where routine tasks become automated and the real value lies in understanding problems, guiding decisions, and building the right outcomes.



## The Traditional View of Engineers

The traditional engineers vs engineers that stand out

### Engineering Education Today (education)

Most engineers are taught how to build things. We learn all the engineer skillsets, understand various tradeoffs in system design, and implement the most efficient algorithm. 
How to break complex problems into steps.
Think logically and critically.

### Engineers in Traditional Organizations

Engineers Got Boxed Into “Just Build It”
In the name of efficiency, we separated the thinkers from the builders. Product teams wrote the requirements. Managers tracked the work. The engineers just executed.

At a lot of the companies, engineers come during product implementation. Engineers will discuss how to minimize these engineers’ efforts in building this product. Engineers think deeply about scaling, performance, and how to build such a product. Software Engineer interview often asks about algorithm efficiency, system design, and scalability problems, but less often talks about the product; because those seem like the job of a product manager. We never ask about why to build such a product.

In the traditional model, development follows a linear path. Requirements flow down from product management through design to engineering teams who implement them. Think of it as a relay race, where each team passes the baton to the next.
- Requirements documents took months to create and approve
- Engineers coded to exact specifications
- Testing and deployment came at the end
- Customer feedback was filtered through multiple layers

### There are Engineers that Stand Out

But even that (the education and the traditional software organizations), there are engineers that developed a lot of strong interest in the product itself. They want to understand how the product brings value to the business and love making product decisions.

These engineers are not only good at identifying engineer challenges but also product challenges.

These engineers are moving beyond code delivery to solving real user problems.

This kind of engineer can have a huge impact on creating a great product.

"Good engineering isn’t just about coding, it’s about asking the right questions."
"Good engineering is not about execting tasks, but asking the right questions, challenging assumptions and understanding the bigger picture."

They are product-minded engineers.



## Product-Minded Engineer

Product-minded engineer traits and how PM could help them shine

### Product Understanding

Traits
- Curiosity and a keen interest in "why?" (Ask questions. Listened.)
- Interest in the business
- Understand how the end-user uses the product that you built (user behavior and data)

AS a PM
- Give them direct exposure to customers
- Never do customer research or interviews without engineers
- Example: 3Shape - dental offices in Denmark observation

### Product Judgment

Traits
- Proactive with product ideas/opinions
- Offering product/engineering tradeoffs upfront
- Practical handling of edge cases
- Bring healthy conflict

AS a PM
- Embrace this. They’re questioning the work, not you as a person.
- They are not trying to take your job or replace you. They’re helping you.
- Start by assuming they’re onto something, rather than seeking to defend your point of view.
- It’s not rebellion. It’s ownership. They care about the product.

### Feedback

Traits
- Seek early feedback
- Quick product validation cycles
    * A/B testing is one of the tools
- Strong product instincts through repeated cycles of learning
    * Google Analytics and monitoring the error reporting tools

AS a PM
- Empower engineers to have direct exposure to those feedback loops
- Empower product-minded engineers with responsibility to triage incoming feedback

### Collaboration

Traits
- Great communicator
- Great relationships with non-engineers
- End-to-end product feature ownership (Strong sense of product ownership)
    *  After rollout, they still actively engage with product managers, data scientists, and customer support channels, to learn how the feature is being used in the real world. It can take weeks to get enough reliable data to draw conclusions. 

AS a PM
- Encourage engineers to share their learnings
- Work on draft content alongside the engineers
- Give them opportunities to present to stakeholders



## Becoming a More Product-Minded Engineer

### Understand how and why your company is successful

What is the business model?
How is money made?
What parts are most profitable, what parts of the company are expanding the most?
Why?
How does your team fit into all of this?

Be curious (have empathy, care), ask questions!
- Why are we doing this?
- Who are we doing this for?
- How is this gonna help them?
- How the customers are using this?

After shiping it, follow with questions.
- How did it go?
- What do customers think?
- What do we learned from the deployment? 
- Do they like it, do they have some feedback?
- How can we improve it?

Other questions

- Who are our users?
- What problem do we solve?
- What is our unique value proposition? Or: What is our competitive advantage?
- How do we measure success?
- What is our business model?
- What are the existing alternatives?


### Build a strong relationship with your product manager

Most product managers jump at the opportunity to mentor engineers. Having engineers be interested in product means they can scale themselves more. Before coming in, asking a lot of product questions, take time to build this relationship and make it clear to your product manager, that you'd like to get more involved in product topics.

### Engage in user research, customer support, and other activities

Where you can learn more about how the product works. Pair with designers, UX people, data scientists, operations people and others, who frequently interact with users.

### Bring well-backed product suggestions to the table.

After you have a good understanding of the business, the product and stakeholders: take initiative. You could bring small suggestions to a project you are working on. Or you could suggest a larger effort, outlining the engineering effort and the product effort, making this easy to prioritize in the backlog.

### Offer product/engineering tradeoffs

Think of not only making engineering tradeoffs for the product feature your team is building but suggest product tradeoffs that result in less engineering effort. Be open to the feedback on these from others.



## Common Misconceptions

### Common Misconceptions

- Product Minded ≠ Product Manager \
Engineers do not replace PMs; they complement them.

- Product Minded ≠ Saying “Yes” to Everything \
In fact, product-minded engineers often advocate for less.

- Product Minded ≠ Overengineering \
Focus on minimal solutions that deliver value.	

- Product Minded ≠ Code Quality doesn't Matter (just ship code) \
NOSENSE!!! Remember, the Clean Code will always matter - the code quality is part of the engineering.



## Age of AI-Driven Development


### How AI Supports Engineering

AI chats:\
ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

AI coding assistants and agents:\
Copilot, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, etc...

AI generates boilerplates. It's writing the same API endpoints, the same database connections, and the same configuration files that millions of others have written before.\
AI creates prototypes - "One-Shot" Prototype.
AI writes unit tests.\
AI helps with Legacy Code.\
AI helps translating form one to another language.\
So in short, AI handles all that repetitive coding (the boring stuff) that was already available - using stackoverflow, or google search. But now much faster, instantly and it's integrated in our IDEs. So it saves us much more time on the boring stufs where we could focus on the bigger picture.\
AI helps with understanding the code.\
AI helps with the PR reviews.\
AI helps with the CI\CD.

"AI is like having a very eager junior developer on your team... they can write code quickly, but they need constant supervision and correction."
Or like I'm saying
"AI is like a junior on 10 redbulls that is writing code with light speed, but writes only what is requested from him and not having the big picture - this is where you need to lead him through the process (monitor and suppervise)".


### Product-Minded Engineers and AI-Driven Development

AI coding assistants and agents now do a lot of heavy lifting for us, taking care of small details so we can focus more on other topics. Topics like product thinking.

- AI Automates Tasks, Not Understanding
- AI writes code and tests, but cannot understand user intent or business goals.
- AI accelerates the technical side, making judgment and context even more valuable
- AI Increases the Importance of Product Thinking
- AI as an Amplifier for Product-Minded Engineers
    * Those who understand the product can direct AI more effectively.


### The Future Belongs to Product-Minded Engineers

The Product-minded engineers is even more needed in the AI-driven development where we'll have more time to focus on the product.\
In an age where AI handles the syntax, engineers who master user empathy and product thinking will define the future of software.\
Product-minded engineers will outperform other engineers in an AI-accelerated world.
